Great job!
Suggestions:
+ Suggest creating an adapter to handle ajax calls
+ Create a smaller functions to break up the logic happening after on submit action, like a render function that appends to DOM. Overall app.js is a little confusing to follow
+ Models look good. Controllers look pretty good too
